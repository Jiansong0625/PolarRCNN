# AFPL-Net Loss Function Optimization

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced loss function for AFPL-Net, inspired by state-of-the-art polar-based and anchor-free detection methods including **PolarMask**, **FCOS**, and **Polar R-CNN**.

## Problem Statement

The original AFPL-Net loss consisted of three simple components:
1. **Focal Loss** for classification
2. **BCE Loss** for centerness
3. **Smooth L1 Loss** for polar regression (θ, r)

While functional, this baseline approach had several limitations:
- Classification and quality (centerness) were treated independently
- Polar coordinate regression lacked geometric understanding
- No mechanism to balance theta vs radius losses
- Risk of gradient imbalance between loss components

## Research & Inspiration

### PolarMask (Instance Segmentation)
- Introduced **Polar IoU** for better geometric optimization
- Uses **quality-aware classification** to integrate IoU into classification
- Per-pixel polar coordinate prediction

### FCOS (Object Detection)
- **Quality Focal Loss** combines classification with quality estimation
- **Centerness** for filtering low-quality predictions
- Gradient normalization for balanced multi-task learning

### Polar R-CNN (Lane Detection)
- Global pole concept for lane detection
- Polar coordinate representation for lanes
- Multi-stage architecture

## Enhanced Loss Components

### 1. Quality Focal Loss (QFL)

**Motivation**: Instead of treating classification as a binary task, integrate quality information (centerness) directly into the classification objective.

**Key Innovation**:
- For **positive samples**: Train classifier to predict quality score (centerness), not just binary presence
- For **negative samples**: Standard focal loss focusing on hard negatives

**Formula**:
```
For positives: Loss = |pred - quality|^β * CE(pred, quality)
For negatives: Loss = (1 - pred)^β * CE(pred, 0)
```

**Benefits**:
- Better quality estimates at inference time
- Naturally suppresses low-quality detections
- Single head predicts both presence AND quality

**Implementation**:
```python
class QualityFocalLoss(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, pred, target, quality_target=None):
        # For negatives: standard focal loss
        # For positives: weight by quality mismatch
        modulation = torch.where(
            target > 0,
            torch.abs(pred_prob - quality_target) ** self.beta,
            (1 - pred_prob) ** self.beta
        )
        loss = modulation * ce_loss
```

### 2. Polar IoU Loss

**Motivation**: Smooth L1 loss treats θ and r independently, ignoring the geometric relationship in polar space. We want to optimize the actual overlap between predicted and ground truth polar regions.

**Key Innovation**:
- Compute overlap in polar space considering both radial and angular components
- Radial component: `r_min / r_max` (similar to linear IoU)
- Angular component: `exp(-|θ_pred - θ_target|)` (smooth decay with angle difference)
- Combined: `Polar IoU = (r_min/r_max) * exp(-|Δθ|)`

**Formula**:
```
r_iou = min(r_pred, r_target) / max(r_pred, r_target)
angle_weight = exp(-|θ_pred - θ_target|)
polar_iou = r_iou * angle_weight
loss = 1 - polar_iou
```

**Benefits**:
- Better geometric understanding
- Points with similar angles naturally grouped
- Helps with lane coherence

**Implementation**:
```python
class PolarIoULoss(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, theta_pred, r_pred, theta_target, r_target, mask):
        # Radial IoU
        r_iou = torch.min(r_pred, r_target) / torch.max(r_pred, r_target)
        
        # Angular similarity
        angle_diff = wrap_angle(theta_pred - theta_target)
        angle_weight = torch.exp(-torch.abs(angle_diff))
        
        # Combined polar IoU
        polar_iou = r_iou * angle_weight
        return 1.0 - polar_iou
```

### 3. Uncertainty-Based Weighting

**Motivation**: How should we balance theta loss vs radius loss? They have different scales and importance. Manual tuning is tedious.

**Key Innovation**:
- Learn task-specific uncertainty (variance) for theta and radius
- Higher uncertainty = lower contribution to loss
- Automatically balances based on task difficulty

**Formula**:
```
loss_theta_weighted = (1 / 2σ_θ²) * loss_theta + log(σ_θ)
loss_r_weighted = (1 / 2σ_r²) * loss_r + log(σ_r)
total = loss_theta_weighted + loss_r_weighted
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic task balancing
- No manual weight tuning
- Adapts during training

**Implementation**:
```python
class PolarRegressionLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, use_uncertainty=True):
        # Learnable log variance (for stability)
        self.log_var_theta = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))
        self.log_var_r = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))
    
    def forward(self, ...):
        precision_theta = torch.exp(-self.log_var_theta)
        precision_r = torch.exp(-self.log_var_r)
        
        total_loss = (
            precision_theta * theta_loss + self.log_var_theta +
            precision_r * r_loss + self.log_var_r
        )
```

### 4. Gradient Normalization

**Motivation**: Different loss components may have vastly different magnitudes. One loss might dominate gradient flow, causing training instability.

**Key Innovation**:
- Track running mean of each loss component
- Normalize losses by their running means before weighted combination
- Prevents any single loss from dominating

**Formula**:
```
normalized_loss_i = loss_i / running_mean(loss_i)
total = Σ weight_i * normalized_loss_i
```

**Benefits**:
- Balanced gradient flow
- More stable training
- Each loss contributes proportionally

**Implementation**:
```python
def gradient_normalize(self, losses_dict):
    # Update running means (EMA)
    self.loss_cls_mean = 0.9 * self.loss_cls_mean + 0.1 * loss_cls.detach()
    
    # Normalize by running means
    normalized_loss_cls = loss_cls / (self.loss_cls_mean + eps)
    # ... same for other losses
    
    return normalized_losses
```

## Configuration Options

The enhanced loss is highly configurable via the config file:

```python
# Standard weights
cls_loss_weight = 1.0
centerness_loss_weight = 1.0
regression_loss_weight = 2.0

# Quality Focal Loss (recommended: True)
use_quality_focal = True  # Integrate centerness into classification

# Polar IoU Loss (recommended: True)
use_polar_iou = True  # Better geometric understanding
polar_iou_weight = 0.5
polar_iou_type = 'iou'  # or 'giou'

# Uncertainty weighting (experimental)
use_uncertainty = False  # Automatic theta/r balancing

# Gradient normalization (recommended: True)
use_grad_norm = True  # Balanced training
```

## Recommended Settings

### Default (Recommended for Most Cases)
```python
use_quality_focal = True
use_polar_iou = True
polar_iou_weight = 0.5
use_uncertainty = False
use_grad_norm = True
```

This provides a good balance of improvements without experimental features.

### Conservative (Minimal Changes)
```python
use_quality_focal = False
use_polar_iou = False
use_uncertainty = False
use_grad_norm = False
```

Falls back to baseline loss for comparison.

### Aggressive (All Features)
```python
use_quality_focal = True
use_polar_iou = True
polar_iou_weight = 0.5
polar_iou_type = 'giou'
use_uncertainty = True
use_grad_norm = True
```

Enables all optimization features including experimental ones.

## Theoretical Background

### Quality Focal Loss

Based on:
- Tian et al. "FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection" (ICCV 2019)
- Li et al. "Generalized Focal Loss" (NeurIPS 2020)

The key insight: Classification confidence should reflect detection quality (IoU/centerness), not just binary presence. This produces better NMS-free results.

### Polar IoU

Inspired by:
- Xie et al. "PolarMask: Single Shot Instance Segmentation with Polar Representation" (CVPR 2020)

Standard coordinate regression (L1/L2) doesn't capture geometric constraints. IoU-based losses provide better shape understanding by directly optimizing overlap.

### Uncertainty Weighting

Based on:
- Kendall et al. "Multi-Task Learning Using Uncertainty to Weigh Losses" (CVPR 2018)

Multi-task learning requires balancing different losses. Uncertainty weighting automatically learns task-specific weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty.

### Gradient Normalization

Inspired by:
- Chen et al. "GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing" (ICML 2018)

Prevents gradient imbalance in multi-task learning by normalizing loss magnitudes.

## Ablation Study Recommendations

To understand the contribution of each component:

1. **Baseline**: All features disabled
2. **+ Quality Focal**: Enable `use_quality_focal`
3. **+ Polar IoU**: Enable `use_polar_iou`
4. **+ Grad Norm**: Enable `use_grad_norm`
5. **Full**: All enabled

Train each configuration and compare:
- Final F1 score
- Training stability (loss curves)
- Inference quality (visual inspection)

## Future Work

Potential further improvements:

1. **Adaptive Loss Weights**: Learn optimal weights during training
2. **Focal IoU Loss**: Combine focal loss focusing with IoU
3. **Distance Transform Loss**: Utilize distance transform for better centerness
4. **Contrastive Loss**: Push lanes apart in feature space
5. **Temporal Consistency**: Video-based lane detection
